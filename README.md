## Clinical Trials Map

Clinical Trails Map is a heatmap data visualization of data from 
[clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/). It uses Create React App, 
Material-UI, the [clinicaltrials.gov API](https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/gui), 
and the [Mapbox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/).

The goal of the map is to provide an intuitive and visualy compelling way to navegate a 
number of different layers of information from clinicaltrials.gov, including trial location,
overall status, study type, and intervention type.
